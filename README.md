## Look outs 

> If using the bar does not fully fit ur screen.... head over to ```~/.config/waybar/config``` and edit the first 4-5 lines to better suit it to your taste/screen


## rice specific info

> Does not use any motification manager because I dont really need any notifications popping up
>
> Does use transparency
>
> Only has 5 workspaces due to me not requiring any more than that... incase more is needed, it can be added
