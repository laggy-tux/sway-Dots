## Things to look out for

> *Refer the [cheatSheet](https://github.com/laggy-tux/sway-Dots/blob/main/cheatsheet) as modifications have been made to the sway shortcuts*
>
> To add and remove stuufs to the *waybar* check ```~/.config.waybar/config``` there are modules for weather and other things which i have not added
>
> If the powermenu does not work please:
 ```
chmod +x path/to/wofi-power.sh
./wofi-power.sh
```

##

## Rice specific info

> Does not use any motification manager because I dont really need any notifications popping up
>
> Does use transparency
>
> Only has 5 workspaces due to me not requiring any more than that... incase more is needed, it can be added
